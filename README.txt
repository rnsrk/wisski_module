INTRODUCTION
------------

WissKI is a German acronym for "Wissenschaftliche
KommunikationsInfrastruktur", which can be translated as "Scientific
Communication Infrastructure". It is a Virtual Research Environment (VRE)
for managing scholarly data that is completely open source and free to use.
Based on Drupal WissKI is a flexible tool for data collections that enables
researchers to work simultaneously from different places. WissKI provides
benefits of the semantic web technology while supporting simple and common
input interfaces. The semi-automatic text annotation is one of its core
features. We developed a software system that enables scientific projects
especially in memory institutions (museums, archives, libraries) to collect,
store, manage and communicate knowledge. Therefore it addresses many facets
of research in a network environment like persistence of information,
long-time preservation and accessibility, digital documentation standards
and e-publishing.

WissKI was initially a joint venture featuring three partners from different
institutions and scientific domains: The Digital Humanities Research Group
of the Department of Computer Science at the Friedrich-Alexander-University
of Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU), the Department of Museum Informatics at the
Germanisches Nationalmuseum (GNM) in Nuremberg and the Biodiversity
Informatics Group at the Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig
(ZFMK) in Bonn. Software development was primarily funded by the German
Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) from 2009 to 2012
and from 2014 to 2017.
